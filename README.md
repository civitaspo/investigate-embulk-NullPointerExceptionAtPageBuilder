Use https://github.com/civitaspo/embulk-filter-jruby_call_dataerror and https://github.com/civitaspo/embulk-parser-catch_data_exception

I found embulk-java-parser plugin catch embulk-jruby-filter ::Embulk::DataError sometimes. This repository is for investigating the error.
But, I couldn't get the error. I can see it only in our company environment...why...
